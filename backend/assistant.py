"""The Assistant: every person's own private chat with the company's assistant bot (docs/assistant.md).

One room per person (`rooms.ASSISTANT_ROOM`, scope personal, owner_actor the person): only they
read it or post in it, the owner and administrators included. A message goes one of two ways:

* the fast path answers on the server, from Tico's own data, with no runner turn: what is waiting
  on you, a search, "open X", what a bot did today, how to do something (docs/*.md). The person
  sees the answer at once (a bot turn is 30 seconds or more);
* everything else is a turn of the assistant bot on the company's runner. That turn acts as the
  person and never more: `Auth.authenticate` maps its token to the person (`assistant_principal`),
  so every hub tool it calls is checked, and audited "via assistant", exactly as if they had made
  the call. Low-risk writes run directly (`write_allowed`); anything with a side effect that
  matters is proposed as a pending action, and only the person's own click (`confirm`) runs it,
  through the same routes with their own credential. The bot itself can never confirm.
