"""The stable v2 contract for a team's own frontend: `GET /api/v2/openapi.json`.

FastAPI would describe every route, runner and bot endpoint included. A frontend team needs the
resources a person's app is built from, so this module keeps only those (STABLE below), names
each operation, groups them by resource and describes the answers a person gets. Handlers return
plain dictionaries rather than response models, so the answer shapes are declared here; a test
(backend/tests/test_openapi_v2.py) checks them against live responses, and that the committed copy
`docs/openapi/v2.json` matches. Regenerate it with `python -m backend.openapi_v2`.

Anything not listed is internal and may change in any release. See docs/api.md.
