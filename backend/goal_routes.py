"""The goals, KPIs, check-ins and proposals API (docs/goals-and-kpis.md).

Who may do what, in one place. Company goals and KPIs are visible to everyone signed in; a bot's own
are visible to whoever may Read the bot (docs/permissions.md). A goal's owner, the owner of the goal
it serves and anyone above the owner on the org chart set its colour and its KPIs. A KPI's owner (or
anyone above them; the company owner for a company KPI) edits it and its readings. The Goal Manager,
the built-in steward of every KPI, reads all of them and writes readings and automatic colours, and
nothing else: a change to a definition or a target it is judged against is a proposal that a
person confirms.
