"""`hub`: what a bot calls inside a turn to talk to Tico.

Thin on purpose (docs/history/hub-v2.md §5): parse the arguments, hand them to `clients/remotecli.py`,
which makes one HTTP call against the Tico API and prints JSON on stdout. Every rule lives on
the server (`backend/hubdb.py`), never here. A command is its tool's name (clients/hubtools.py) with
`hub_` dropped: `hub message send` is `hub_message_send`, `hub bot go-live` is `hub_bot_go_live`.

The commands of the last release keep working for one more release, hidden: each prints a one-line "renamed to"
notice on stderr and runs the new command (RENAMED below).

Exit codes: 0 fine, 2 `{"refused": <rule>, "detail": "..."}` or a non-retryable API error,
1 `{"error": "..."}` (bad arguments, no identity, or the API could not be reached).

Identity (§3): a bot is `HUB_BOT` + `HUB_TOKEN` from the run's environment (`HUB_EMPLOYEE` is the old name for
`HUB_BOT`, still read); the runner sets both, with `HUB_API_URL` and `HUB_WORKSPACE` (where this company's bot
repositories live), for every run. There is no `--as`. `--human <id>` is still
parsed so an old command line is not misread, and the API refuses it: remote identity comes
from authentication. Outside a run, `hub sql` and the tool reads (`tool list`, `tool show`,
`tool query-search`) fall back to this Mac's runner credential (`~/.config/tico/runner.json`); `sql`
queries as the person who registered the computer. A person's own script sets `HUB_API_URL` and a personal
API token as `HUB_TOKEN` (Settings, Computers, API tokens) and no `HUB_BOT`: every command is
then that person (docs/how-it-works.md, "Calling the API from a script").
