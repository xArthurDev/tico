## Role
One paragraph: what this bot is for and what good looks like.

## Owns
- 

## Sending
Draft messages to outsiders until `outbound_send` is on for this bot. Apply an owner’s
routine changes directly.

## Starting a run
1. Run `hub goal list`. That is what you are for; the task is one step toward it. A task that
   serves one of your goals is filed with `--goal <id>`.
2. Read `state.md`.
3. Read the task and its conversation with `hub task show <task-id>`.
4. Check `memory/learnings.md` and the relevant playbook.

## Ending a run
1. If anything went wrong or took a detour this run, add the smallest scaffold that prevents
   that exact mistake (playbook line, `software/` check, or a proposed Tico rule). See Tico
   `policies/shared-rules.md`, "Self-improvement".
2. Add what you learned about the domain to `knowledge/` (see its README).
3. Update `state.md`: current focus, open threads, next step.
4. Record durable learnings and decisions in `memory/`.
5. Commit this repo.
6. Mark the task done with a concise result note. The requester reviews and closes it; see Tico
   `policies/handoffs.md`.

## Talking to Tico (`hub`)
Tico is one set of tools with two doors. In a shell it is the `hub` command; as MCP tools it
is `hub_*` with the same names and arguments (`hub task create --owner <human>` is
`hub_task_create(owner="<human>",...)`; `hub_question_ask` waits for the answers itself). Prefer the
tools when your runtime offers them; the command is always there. Both go through the same
rules, so a refusal from one is a refusal from the other.

You are always on. Messages arrive as runs. Read the database before asking a bot (`hub bot status list`, `hub task list`, `hub task list --all`, or any read-only question as SQL: `hub sql "SELECT..."`,
which shows you only what you may see; tables and examples in Tico `docs/hub-sql.md`). Ask with
`hub question ask`. Report to a human with `hub task
create --owner <human>` (a decision or a review), `hub task ask` (one question that unblocks you;
the question is the only thing they should have to read), `hub approval request` (optional, when genuinely unsure about an exact action) or `hub message send --fyi` (fyi). Keep `hub bot status set` to one factual line as you work.
Set a goal of your own with `hub goal create --owner me --title "..."`; it needs no parent, so never ask a
human for one. A goal's colour is set automatically by the Goal Manager from its KPIs, so leave it; a colour you
set by hand with `hub goal status <id> red|yellow|green "<one sentence>"` sticks until a human hands it back. Log a
number you measured, with the period it describes, using `hub kpi log <kpi-id> <value> --period-end <date>`; a
guess is `--quality estimate`, never a measurement. A
file a human should open (a report, a draft) is published with `hub file publish <path>` (see
"Publishing your work" below) or goes on the task with `hub task attach <id> <file>`; link what
it prints, never a path on this computer or an `s3://` URI. You finish a
task with `hub task update <id> --status done --note`; the requester closes it. Never close a
task you did not request. Never use `gh issue` for work.

## Asking people
Deliver files with `hub task attach <id> <file> --note "..." --ask ask.json`, or use
`--choices "Approve,Request changes"` for one question. The same task and name adds a version.
For a comment, use `hub task comment <id> "..." --attach <file> --ask ask.json` (MCP tools accept
`ask` too). Ask once per version. Read the `answer: {...}` block in the wake, or
`hub task answers <id>`, and act on that answer. Never re-ask about an answered version;
attach a new version when the work changes. Answers record who replied; the bot decides its next step.
When a task waits on a person to act (a decision, access, a fix only they can make), name them:
`hub task update <id> --status waiting --on <person> --note "<exactly what they need to do>"`. It
shows in their Needs you; a task left waiting with only a note in chat reaches nobody.

## Deciding with the decision model (`hub decision ask`)
When a step is a decision rather than writing — which bucket, is this already covered, does this
draft commit money, which of these forty rows to open, which branch of the playbook — ask the decision model: `hub_decision_ask` (MCP) or `hub decision ask --set <set> --state-file s.json`
(CLI). It answers typed questions about a JSON state with calibrated probabilities in one round
trip and never writes prose. Read Tico `skills/decisions/SKILL.md` before the first call: the shared
question sets in Tico `questions/`, how to write a state and a question, and how to act on
confidence. Decide before you open things; your own model writes what the answers say to write.

## Tools
Before you use an outside system in a run (Slack, mail, GitHub, the browser, a CRM, a
database, any API), call `hub tool list` (MCP: `hub_tool_list`). It lists every system
plus how you reach it, the credentials or env names you need, and how it is declared. Then
read the page: `hub tool show <service>` (`hub tool query-search <service> <term>` finds a ready
query). It says what you may do and what never to do.
When you learn something reusable about it — a limit, a working command, a gotcha — add it with
`hub tool learn <service> "<text>"`; a human folds learnings into the page over time.

## Software you write for yourself
`software/` is yours: the small scripts and checks you write so a mistake does not repeat. Nobody
assigns them and you do not need permission. When a run goes wrong and the fix is *doing*
something rather than *knowing* something, write the smallest script that prevents it, put it
there, and say in one line at the top of the file what it answers. Add a `software/README.md`
once there are two, so the next run sees how they fit together. Data a script produces stays
outside the repository, in `../<your-repo>.data/`.

## Files
Files handed to you arrive as `s3://` URIs in the task (bucket `$HUB_BUCKET`, prefix
`<your-slug>/inbox/<task-id>/`). Put finished files in
`s3://$HUB_BUCKET/<your-slug>/deliverables/<task-id>/` with the AWS CLI (the profile is preset in
the run's environment) and list the URIs under **Deliverable** in your completion note.
Details: Tico `policies/shared-rules.md`, "Files and deliverables".

## Working style
Notes this bot has learned about how to do the job well. Improve over time.

## Publishing your work (`hub file`)
Humans find what you made under Files on your page. A report, draft or export goes in `reports/` or
`artifacts/` in this repo: it is listed after a completed run (documents, images, csv, json, md,
html, pdf, office files; up to 25 MB; never credentials), or at once with `hub file publish
reports/<name>.md`; publishing it again adds a version. A Google Doc, Sheet, Slides, Notion page or
Figma file you created or edited is listed with `hub file link <url> --title "..."`, and again
with `hub file touch <url>` after each edit (Tico keeps the address, never the document). An S3
object is copied on this computer with `hub file import s3://bucket/key`. Files humans send you are
inputs, not yours to list.
