"""The runtime host interface the runner talks to.

A *host* owns one runtime (Codex, Claude, Gemini, Grok Build, or the fake used by tests) and hides its wire
protocol behind seven calls and one event queue. The runner never speaks JSON-RPC; it starts
threads, starts turns, and drains events.

    host.start()                                   # bring the runtime up
    tid = host.start_thread("coo", settings)       # a persistent thread for one bot
    tid = host.resume_thread("coo", tid, settings) # after a restart
    turn = host.start_turn(tid, "text")            # one turn on that thread
    host.steer(tid, turn, "text")                  # mid-turn input
    host.interrupt(tid, turn)
    for ev in host.drain(): ...                    # events, oldest first

`settings` is a plain dict so a host can ignore what it does not understand:

    cwd     str   the bot's repo (required)
    model   str   runtime model id, None for the runtime's default
    effort  str   reasoning effort, None for the default
    env     dict  the environment the turn's shell commands get (`Runner.environment`: the
                  bot's secrets plus HUB_API_URL / HUB_TOKEN / HUB_BOT / HUB_EMPLOYEE / HUB_DIR /
                  HUB_WORKSPACE)
    slug    str   the bot, for logging

Events are dicts. Every event carries `kind`, `thread_id` and `turn_id` (either may be None):

    delta          text          a streamed fragment of the agent's reply
    message        text, final   a complete agent message; `final` is the turn's answer
    turn_completed status        the turn ended (status "completed" | "interrupted")
    turn_failed    error, limit  the turn failed; `limit` is True for a usage-limit error
    status         state         "idle" | "active" for the thread
    tokens         input, output, total; `usage` {input, cached, output} is this event's increment
                   (input counts cached tokens too), emitted once per token (runner/usage.py sums it)
    rate_limits    used_percent, window_minutes, resets_at (ISO-8601 UTC)
    error          error         host-level trouble; `host_restart` True when the process was
                                 restarted and the runner must re-resume its threads
